# Puppy potty schedule app using Python/Django

# Introduction
I worked on building my own app that allows you to use CRUD functionality to keep track of your puppies potty schedule using the djgano framework. There were different stories describing the tasks that needed to be completed for the app through Azure Devops. As I progressed I built the front end and back end side of my app. It was a great opportunity to do live problem solving without a tutorial guiding every step of the way. The IDE used was PyCharm. I'm proud of this app and its design and functionality given the timeframe. This was done during a two week sprint that allowed me the chance to utilize my project management skills that I learned which will be continued to be used throughout my career.

Below are descriptions of the stories that were worked on and finished. Theres seperate screenshots of the code associated and how the app looks and works.

## CRUD

### Story 1: Create a new app for the project, named appropriately for what you are tracking, and get it to display a home page with basic content.

### Story 2: Create a model for the collection item you will be tracking and add the ability to create a new item.

### Story 3: Display information from the database in a page.

### Story 4: Create a details page that will show the details of any single item from within the database, as selected by the user. Link this to the index page for each item.

### Story 5: Allow for edits and delete functions to be done from the details page or from separate pages. Have confirmation before deleting.

### Story 6: Create a new template for displaying information sourced from another website. Use Beautiful Soup to data scrape the site and find the relevant information.

### Skills Learned
Working on a deadline and having daily standup taught me how to stay on schedule and adhere to the work schedule I set out to for the day or having to make the neccessary adjustments if my original timeline didnt go as planned. 
I also learned that nothing should be named the same thing as your model or the computer wont understand what you're trying to call to function. Plus, it also gets confusing on my end when I'm looking through my code and the same name is being used for different functions or labels especially when there is an error.
