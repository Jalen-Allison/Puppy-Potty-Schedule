# Puppy potty schedule app using Python/Django

# Introduction
During this two-week sprint, I built the front end and backside of an app that allows you to use CRUD functionality to keep track of your puppy's potty schedule using python and Django framework. The IDE used was PyCharm. There were different stories describing the tasks that needed to be completed for the app through Azure DevOps. There was a daily stand-up with other developers discussing roadblocks, what we have been working on, and what we plan on getting done that day. 

Below are descriptions of the stories that were worked on and finished. Theres seperate screenshots of the code associated and how the app looks and works.

# Project

### Story 1: Create a new app for the project, named appropriately for what you are tracking, and get it to display a home page with basic content.

### Story 2: Create a model for the collection item you will be tracking and add the ability to create a new item.

### Story 3: Display information from the database in a page.

### Story 4: Create a details page that will show the details of any single item from within the database, as selected by the user. Link this to the index page for each item.

### Story 5: Allow for edits and delete functions to be done from the details page or from separate pages. Have confirmation before deleting.

### Story 6: Create a new template for displaying information sourced from another website. Use Beautiful Soup to data scrape the site and find the relevant information.

### Skills Learned
My main hurdle that I learned from was that nothing should be named the same thing as your model or the computer wont understand what you're trying to call to function. Plus, it also gets confusing on my end when I'm looking through my code and the same name is being used for different functions or labels especially when there is an error.
Working on a deadline and having daily standup taught me how to stay on schedule and adhere to the work schedule I set out to for the day or having to make the neccessary adjustments if my original timeline didnt go as planned.
